Blockchain conversations often start and stop with tokens. The more durable story is about shared, verifiable records.

## Where adoption is growing

Organizations are testing blockchain for:

- Supply-chain traceability
- Cross-border document verification
- Digital identity and credential systems

## Why this matters

In any process involving multiple institutions, record disputes are expensive. A tamper-resistant ledger can reduce reconciliation work and lower fraud exposure.

## What still blocks adoption

The biggest constraints are governance, interoperability, and legal clarity. Technology is only one part of the system.

Adoption succeeds when institutions agree on standards first, then select tools.
